A drowsiness detector to protect people from irresponsible death while fatigue struck driving.

Drowsy driving is a major problem on Indian Roads with 20-30% of car accidents and 57% of truck accidents being caused due to it. It is known that for a person that did not have sleep for 18 hours, the Blood Alcohol Concentration(BAC) is equivalent to 0.05 and for 24 hours, it is equivalent to 0.10. A legally drunk person has a BAC of 0.08, hence multiple people get struck with accidents being struck with fatigue over multiple days.

Hence, it is extremely important to deploy a drowsiness detector to protect ourselves.

The product works on a simple eye aspect ratio technology. We detect the 68 facial landmarks on the face and then the computer recognises the eyes. Calculation of eye aspect ratio is carried out with 6 points near eyes. The threshold linit can be analytically trained person to person and hence, a base threshold can be set demographically.
